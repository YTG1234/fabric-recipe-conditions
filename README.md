# Fabric Recipe Conditions
Fabric Recipe Conditions is a library that extends recipes with the ability to load conditionally.<br/>
Currently, the conditions are only checked when the resources reload (world load or `/reload`), but most of the built-in
conditions require a restart/reload to even be changed anyway.
